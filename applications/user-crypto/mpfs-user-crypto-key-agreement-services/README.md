# PolarFire SoC MSS User Crypto Key Agreement Services Example

This example project demonstrates the use of the User Crypto key agreement 
services using the following functions.

   - CALPreCompute()
   - CALExpo()
    
## How to use this example

On connecting PolarFire SoC Video kit J12 to the host PC, you should see 4 COM
port interfaces connected. To use this project configure the COM port
**interface1** as below:
 - 115200 baud
 - 8 data bits
 - 1 stop bit
 - no parity
 - no flow control

The example project will display instructions over the serial port. A greeting
message and menu instructions are displayed over the UART. Follow the instruction 
to use different menu options provided by the example project.

This example project demonstrates the use of User Cyrpto – key agreement service
to derive the shared secret key. It is primarily used as a method of exchanging
cryptography keys for use in symmetric encryption algorithms such as AES. This 
service reads the base value, modules, private key of user A, public key of user
B, and derive the secret key, which can be used for encryption/decryption of 
data and also displayed on the UART terminal.

## Target Hardware

This example project is targeted at PolarFire SoC Video kit (MPFS250TS-1FCG1152I).
The reference design for the PolarFire SoC video kit is available in the
following GitHub repository: [PolarFire® SoC Video Kit Reference Design.](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/polarfire-soc-video-kit-reference-design)

The steps mentioned [here](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/polarfire-soc-video-kit-reference-design)
can be used to generate a *FlashPro Express* job file from above mentioned tcl
script.

This project provides build configurations and debug launchers as explained [here](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/repo-polarfire-soc-bare-metal-examples)

## Configurations

- **PolarFire User Crypto Driver Configuration**
   - **config_user.h** is a custom configuration file for PolarFire SoC CAL
     library. Following are the recommended configuration for config_user.h file.
      
      - Define **g_user_crypto_base_address** global variable as shown below.
        This will used to configure the **PKX0_BASE** (defined in config_user.h)
        and to connect to the User Crypto Co-processor in the Libero design.

     `uint32_t g_user_crypto_base_addr  0x22000000UL;`

      - **SAT_LITTLE_ENDIAN** - Endianness of the processor executing CAL
        Library customization definitions. These definitions enable the
        respective cryptographic services in the CAL which are supported by the
        User Crypto Processor. It is recommended that these definitions are not
        removed or changed unless required. 

   - A symbol INC_STDINT_H is defined in project preprocessor setting. For more
     detail, please refer to caltypes.h file present in CAL folder.

**NOTE:**
   1. If you try to enter data values other than 0 - 9, a - f, A - F, an error 
      message will be displayed on the serial terminal.
   2. You must enter all input data as whole bytes. If you enter the 128-bit
      key {1230...0} as 0x12 0x3 and press return, this will be treated as
      byte0 = 0x12, byte1 = 0x30, byte2-127 = 0x00.

## Macro Script

A macro script is provided with this example which automatically enters the NIST
vectors and associated data to verify the functionality. You can use
Key_agreement.ttl Tera Term Macro script present in project  directory for
testing key agreement Services example project.

**NOTE:**
1. Tera Term Macros don’t work with Windows 10 build 14393.0. You should update
   to Windows 10 build 14393.0.105 or [later.](https://osdn.net/ticket/browse.php?group_id=1412&tid=36526) 
2. Before running Tera Term Macro script, set language as English 
   (Setup->General->Language). Also setup transmit delay in (Setup->Serial port)
   to 5msec/char and 5msec/line.
3. By default, Tera Term log will be stored in Tera Term installation Directory.
