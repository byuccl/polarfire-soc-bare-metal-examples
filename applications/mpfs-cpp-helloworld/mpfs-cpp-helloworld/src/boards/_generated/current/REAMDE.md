# Design description generated by MSS Configurator

When the MSS configurator is invoked from within the SoftConsole, the /_generated/current 
is the default directory where the MSS Configurator will generate the xml output.

The MSS Configurator works on the cfg file. The cfg file for the MSS configurator 
should be placed at /src/boards/\<my-board>/fpga_design/mss_configuration

Eventually, the xml /src/boards/\<my-board>/fpga_design/design_description will not
be provided with the SoftConsole projects, instead the cfg files under /mss_configuration/ will be used.

### Update build step to generate header files from xml configurations Go to:

Softconsole build generates the header information required by the MPFS-HAL from 
the xml output generated by the MSS Configurator.

To update build step to generate header files from xml configurations Go to:

 - SoftConsole project explorer
 - \<project name\> -> Project properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings
 - Select appropriate Build configuration
 - Select "Build steps" tab and change the contents of the "Command"

 ```c
 ${env_var:MACRO_PYTHON_BINARY_PATH_AND_EXECUTABLE} ../src/platform/soc_config_generator/mpfs_configuration_generator.py ../src/boards/_generated/current   ../src/boards/<my-board>
 ```
